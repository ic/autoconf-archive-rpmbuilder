Utils to build autoconf-archive for CentOS
==========================================

If you need autoconf-archive on CentOS, there is no package available to Yum for install. This repository addresses this issue with a script that builds an RPM package from source and installs it.

Usage
-----

Just execute the `install` script with an optional `autoconf-archive` version.

    ./install 2016.09.16

The version defaults to `2016.09.16`.
